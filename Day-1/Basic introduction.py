#50-days-python-challenge

'''
Today I learned about the basic introduction of the python.

what are the modules
 -Built-in Modules
 - External Modules
'''
# example :

import playsound #this module used for playing sound using ai voice for the result

'''
I also Learned about the comments in python
# => used for single line comment
'''''' => used for multiline comments
'''

#Escape sequence character 

'''
Those characters that cannot be directly used in string, we use an escape sequence character

it is backslash \ followed by character we insert
'''

#example

print('hello  I am\' "student" \nwe are here to lern ')
#output: hello  I am' "student" 
# we are here to lern

print("hello", 4,5,6, sep=("&"), end=("nextline \n"))
print("stop")

#output: hello&4&5&6nextline
# stop

'''
sep => used to separate the different output by character we want
end=> used to addany element at the end
\n => used to break the line
